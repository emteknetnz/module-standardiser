# module-standardiser

Used to keep Silverstripe modules to a common standard

Use it as a one-off script run from a laptop

Originally was intended to be used as a GitHub Action in [gha-standards](https://github.com/emteknetnz/gha-standards), though there were permissions issues that prevented that solution from being adopted

## Usage

```
rm -rf modules # if there there was a previous run

php run.php
```
